# FAQ Duplicate Detection Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the duplicate detection process performed on the FAQ data in `data/faqs.json`.

## Process Description
1. **Primary Detection Method**: Compared FAQ objects by lowercase-trimmed "question" field
2. **Detection Logic**: Normalized questions by converting to lowercase and trimming whitespace
3. **Duplicate Definition**: Two FAQs are considered duplicates if their normalized questions are identical
4. **Preservation Strategy**: When duplicates are found, keep the first occurrence and remove subsequent ones

## Results

### Exact Duplicates
- **Total FAQs Analyzed**: 81
- **Exact Duplicates Found**: 0
- **Unique FAQs**: 81
- **Action Required**: None

### Similar Questions Analysis
Using a similarity threshold of 0.5 (50% word overlap using Jaccard similarity), we found 13 pairs of similar questions:

1. **Similarity: 0.57**
   - Q1: "Where can I rent a bicycle?"
   - Q2: "Can I rent a motorbike?"

2. **Similarity: 0.71**
   - Q1: "Where can I rent a bicycle?"
   - Q2: "Where can I rent a car?"

3. **Similarity: 0.55**
   - Q1: "How do I get from the pier to Coconut Beach?"
   - Q2: "How do I get to Bottle Beach?"

4. **Similarity: 0.64**
   - Q1: "What's the best way to get around the island?"
   - Q2: "What's the best way to get cash nearby?"

5. **Similarity: 0.56**
   - Q1: "Is it safe to swim at the beach?"
   - Q2: "Is the beach safe at night?"

And 8 more similar pairs...

## Tools Created

### 1. Basic Duplicate Detection Script (`detect_duplicates.py`)
- Simple script focusing on exact question duplicates
- Compares lowercase-trimmed question fields
- Logs removed duplicates for review
- Creates backup files before modification

### 2. Enhanced Duplicate Detection Script (`detect_duplicates_enhanced.py`)
- Extended functionality with command-line options
- Can check both questions and answers for duplicates
- Includes similarity analysis for near-duplicates
- Configurable similarity thresholds
- Detailed logging with timestamps

## Command Line Usage

### Basic duplicate detection:
```bash
python3 detect_duplicates.py
```

### Enhanced detection with options:
```bash
# Check questions and answers for duplicates
python3 detect_duplicates_enhanced.py --check-answer

# Find similar questions
python3 detect_duplicates_enhanced.py --find-similar

# Custom input/output files
python3 detect_duplicates_enhanced.py --input custom_faqs.json --output clean_faqs.json
```

## Recommendations

1. **No Action Required**: The FAQ data is already clean with no exact duplicates
2. **Monitor Similar Questions**: The 13 similar question pairs identified are likely intentional variations addressing different aspects of related topics
3. **Future Maintenance**: Use these scripts regularly when adding new FAQs to prevent duplicates
4. **Consider Consolidation**: Some similar questions could potentially be consolidated if they address the same core need

## Data Quality Assessment
- ✅ No exact duplicate questions found
- ✅ All 81 FAQs are unique based on question content
- ✅ FAQ structure is consistent and well-formed
- ✅ Data is ready for use without modification

## Files Generated
- `detect_duplicates.py` - Basic duplicate detection script
- `detect_duplicates_enhanced.py` - Enhanced detection with similarity analysis
- `duplicate_detection_report.md` - This summary report

## Conclusion
The FAQ dataset is clean and contains no duplicate entries based on the lowercase-trimmed question field comparison. The duplicate detection system is now in place for future maintenance and quality assurance.
